### Manifest Files (View Directly)
- manifest (repo): https://github.com/Mst888/Photo-Grab/blob/b4b99e8f22b4f8bcaf4828e6ae435761810784f1/manifest.json  
- manifest.chrome (repo): https://github.com/Mst888/Photo-Grab/blob/b4b99e8f22b4f8bcaf4828e6ae435761810784f1/manifest.chrome.json  
- Raw manifest: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mst888/Photo-Grab/b4b99e8f22b4f8bcaf4828e6ae435761810784f1/manifest.json  
- Raw manifest.chrome: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mst888/Photo-Grab/b4b99e8f22b4f8bcaf4828e6ae435761810784f1/manifest.chrome.json

---

### Option A — Ready Package (for users)
1. Download the latest package from Releases or the `web-ext-artifacts/` folder (.zip).  
2. Chrome:
   - Open chrome://extensions/, enable "Developer mode" in the top-right.  
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extracted zip contents.  
3. Firefox:
   - Open about:debugging#runtime → "This Firefox" → "Temporary Add-on" → select the `manifest.json` from the extracted folder or install the .xpi.

Note: For Chrome-specific manifest V3 settings, consult `manifest.chrome.json` in the repo. The build script copies the appropriate manifest where needed.

---

### Option B — From Source (for developers)
1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mst888/Photo-Grab.git
cd Photo-Grab
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Build / package:
```bash
npm run build
```
4. Load the output:
- Output folder: use the build produced in `web-ext-artifacts/`.  
- Chrome: chrome://extensions → Load unpacked → select the build folder.  
- Firefox: `npx web-ext run --source-dir=./src` for quick local testing.

Developer tip:
```bash
npx web-ext run --source-dir=./src
```

---

### Option C — Manual / Manifest Testing
1. Download the raw manifest files from the links above.  
2. Create a new folder and place the manifest plus required assets (popup HTML/CSS/JS, icons, content scripts) into it.  
3. chrome://extensions → Load unpacked → select the folder.

Note: A manifest alone is not sufficient — all referenced files must be in the folder.

---

## Quick Usage — 3 Steps
1. Draw a rectangle on the page to select images (Area Selection).  
2. Adjust filters, Same Size, and naming templates in the popup.  
3. Click "Download" to create a ZIP and save your organized archive.

---

## Security & Permissions
- Required permissions: activeTab / host permissions (listed clearly in the manifest).  
- Privacy: The extension does not collect personal data; it only accesses selected image URLs and image data for download purposes. Review the manifest files to verify permissions.
